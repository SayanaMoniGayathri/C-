STL is a standard template library for C++
It has set of classes and functions
Inbuilt data structures and algorithms 
Fancy keywords like vector<pair<int,string>>, sort(..., cmp)
Major components:
-Algoritms
-Containers
-Iterators and functors

Why STL?
1)Reusability
2)Easy to solve
3)Time saving
4)Optimized Implemetations
5)Passes all test cases.

Prerequisites:
1)C++ : https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
2)Basics of data structures: https://legacy.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/
3)Basic problem solving
